# CMSIS-View

The [**Keil MDK Event Recorder**](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101407/latest/Debugging/Debug-Windows-and-Dialogs/Event-Recorder) is now available as open source component along with tooling.
This repository contains the source code of:

- [**ARM::CMSIS-View**](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-View/main/index.html) software pack that provides the Event Recorder and Fault software components.
- [**EventList**](./tools/eventlist) command line utility that allows to dump the events on command line.
- [**Example Projects**](./Examples) that show the usage of the Event Recorder and Fault components.

## Generating Software Pack

Some helper scripts are provided to generate the release artifacts from this repository.

### Doxygen Documentation

Generating the HTML-formatted documentation from its Doxygen-based source is done via

```sh
CMSIS-View $ ./Doxygen/gen_doc.sh
```

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:

- Doxygen 1.9.2

### CMSIS-Pack Bundle

The CMSIS-Pack bundle can be generated with

```sh
CMSIS-View $ ./gen_pack.sh
```

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:

- Generated documentation (see above)
- 7z/GNU Zip
- packchk (e.g., via CMSIS-Toolbox)
- xmllint (optional)

### Version and Changelog Inference

The version and changelog embedded into the documentation and pack are inferred from the
local Git history. In order to get the full changelog one needs to have a full clone (not
a shallow one) including all release tags.

The version numbers and change logs are taken from the available annotated tags.

### Release Pack

A release is simply done via the GitHub Web UI. The newly created tag needs to have
the pattern `pack/<version>` where `<version>` shall be the SemVer `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
version string for the release. The release description is used as the change log
message for the release.

When using an auto-generated tag (via Web UI) the release description is used as the
annotation message for the generated tag. Alternatively, one can prepare the release
tag in the local clone and add the annotation message independently from creating the
release.

Once the release is published via the GitHub Web UI the release workflow generates the
documentation and the pack (see above) and attaches the resulting pack archive as an
additional asset to the release.

## EventList Utility

The command line utility to decode EventRecorder log files written in Go.

### Compile and Test

To build and EventList run `make.sh` script.

```sh
CMSIS-View/tools/eventlist $ ./make.sh build
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -v -ldflags '-X "..."' -o ./eventlist.exe ./cmd/eventlist

build finished successfully!

CMSIS-View/tools/eventlist $ ./make.sh test
go test ./...
?       eventlist/cmd/make      [no test files]
ok      eventlist/cmd/eventlist 7.584s
ok      eventlist/pkg/elf       6.802s
ok      eventlist/pkg/eval      7.458s
ok      eventlist/pkg/event     7.471s
ok      eventlist/pkg/output    7.645s
ok      eventlist/pkg/xml/scvd  6.808s
```

One can run cross-builds for other than the own host platform by specifying `-arch <arch>`
and/or `-os <os>` on the `make.sh` command line, see `--help` for details.

### Release

A release for EventList utility is done independently from the CMSIS-View pack via
the GitHub Web UI. The release tag must match the pattern `tools/eventlist/<version>`
where `<version>` is a SemVer string.

The GitHub Action release workflow is triggered once a release is published. The
workflow builds release bundles for all supported target platforms and attaches
them as assets to the release.
