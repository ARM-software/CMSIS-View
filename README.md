## Generating Software Pack

Some helper scripts are provided to generate the release artifacts from this repository.

### Doxygen Documentation

Generating the HTML-formatted documentation from its Doxygen-based source is done via

```bash
CMSIS-View $ ./Doxygen/gen_doc.sh
``` 

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:
 - Doxygen 1.9.2

### CMSIS-Pack Bundle

The CMSIS-Pack bundle can be generated with

```bash
CMSIS-View $ ./gen_pack.sh
``` 

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:
 - Generated documentation (see above)
 - 7z
 - packchk
 - xmllint (optional)

### Version and Changelog Inference

The version and changelog embedded into the documentation and pack are inferred from the
local Git history. In order to get the full changelog one needs to have a full clone (not
a shallow one) including all release tags.

One can check the inferred version by calling the helper script:

```bash
CMSIS-View $ ./Scripts/git_describe.sh
Git version: '1.2.4-dev5+g6a00f35'
1.2.4-dev5+g6a00f35
^ ^ ^    ^ ^
| | |    | â”— Commit SHA of the commit used for generation
| | |    â”— Number of commits added since latest tag
| | â”— Patch version from the latest tag incremented by one
| â”— Minor version as in the latest tag
â”— Major version as in the latest tag
``` 

The full changelog can be inspected by calling the helper script:

```bash
CMSIS-View $ ./Scripts/gen_changelog.sh [-h] [-f <format>]
Generating changelog ...

2. For simple tags the committer date and message of the pointed-to commit is used.
