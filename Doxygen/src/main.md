**CMSIS-View** offers software developers methodologies, software components, and utilities that provide visibility into internal operation of embedded applications and software components.

With the software components of CMSIS-View, developers can collect time-accurate event-based information, display program execution status, and analyze fault exceptions. It allows to analyze execution flows, debug potential issues, and measure execution times. The data can be observed in real-time in an IDE or can be saved as a log file during program execution. 

A **Software Component Viewer Description** (*.SCVD) file in \ref SCVD_Format (XML) defines the content that is displayed in the **Component Viewer** and **Event Recorder**.

In addition, using the Event Recorder API, you can annotate your
code so that you can get statistical data on the time spent in a loop or on the energy consumption
(<a href="https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/ULINKplus">ULINKplus</a> required).

Key elements of CMSIS-View are:

- \ref er_use "Event Recorder" - is an embedded software component that provides an [API (function calls)](modules.html) for event annotations in the code.
- \ref evntlst, a command line tool for processing Event Recorder log files.
- \ref fault with infrastructure and functions to store, record, and analyze exception fault information.
