# Fault example (Cortex-M33) {#flt_example_CM33_readme}

## STMicroelectronics B-U585I-IOT02A board

This project is a simple **Fault** component example running on **Arm Cortex-M33** microcontroller
on a STMicroelectronics [**B-U585I-IOT02A**](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html) evaluation board.

The application allows triggering of specific faults upon which the fault information is saved and system is reset.
When system restarts the fault information is output via the **Event Recorder** and via the **STDIO**.

The fault information can also be inspected with **Component Viewer** in a debug session.

   - `WRP2A_PEND`:   Value = 0x0    Address = 0x08100000

## Build and Run

### Build and Run with uVision

To try the example with uVision, do the following steps:
 1. Open the `Fault.uvmpw` in the uVision
 2. Build the `Project: Fault_S` project
 3. Build the `Project: Fault_NS` project
 4. Download the built application to the MCU's Flash
 5. Open the **Serial Terminal** application and connect to the **STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port (COMx)** (115200-8-N-1)
 6. Press **RESET** button on the board
 7. Follow the instructions in the **Serial Terminal** and observe the results

> Note: In the debug session fault information can be inspected in the **Component View** and **Event Recorder** windows

### Build with CMSIS-Toolbox

Alternatively, this example can be built with [**CMSIS-Toolbox**](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox).

To build the example with CMSIS-Toolbox do the following steps:

 1. Use the `csolution` command to create `.cprj` project files (for **Arm Compiler 6** toolchain):
    ```
    csolution convert -s Fault.csolution.yml
    ```
    or, for **GCC** toolchain use the following command:
    ```
    csolution convert -s Fault.csolution.yml -t GCC
    ```
 2. Use the `cbuild` command to create executable files for Secure and Non-secure applications:
    ```
    cbuild ./Secure/Fault_S.Debug+HW.cprj
    cbuild ./NonSecure/Fault_NS.Debug+HW.cprj
    ```
> Note: To run and debug executables built with CMSIS-Toolbox with uVision, it is necessary to adapt uVision settings
    relating to output file, and also adapt Debug.ini and Flash.ini scripts accordingly

## User Interface

This example uses **Serial Terminal** as User Interface.

The fault triggering is done by entering a number via **Serial Terminal** application (see possible values below).

  - 0: terminate the example
  - 1: trigger the Non-Secure fault, Non-Secure data access Memory Management fault
  - 2: trigger the Non-Secure fault, Non-Secure data access Bus fault
  - 3: trigger the Non-Secure fault, Non-Secure undefined instruction Usage fault
  - 4: trigger the Non-Secure fault, Non-Secure divide by 0 Usage fault
  - 5: trigger the Secure fault, Non-Secure data access from Secure RAM memory
  - 6: trigger the Secure fault, Non-Secure instruction execution from Secure Flash memory
  - 7: trigger the Secure fault, Secure undefined instruction Usage fault

## Example details

Clock Settings:
  - XTAL = MSIS =   4 MHz
  - Core =      **160 MHz**

The example contains 2 applications: Secure and Non-Secure.

**Secure application** (bare-metal, no RTOS):
  - setups the system (clocks, power, security and privilege rights (GTZC), caching) according to the CubeMX configuration
  - provides a function for triggering a fault on the Secure side

**Non-Secure application** (uses RTX RTOS and Standard C Library):
  - setups the peripherals used by the non-secure application (LEDs, button, UART1) according to the CubeMX configuration
  - it runs 2 threads:
    - 'AppThread' thread: Blink Green LED with 1 second interval
    - 'FaultTriggerThread' thread: Trigger a fault according to input from the STDIO

When a fault is triggered the fault handler saves the fault information with the **ARM_FaultSave** function.
When valid fault information exists it can be viewed with **Component Viewer** or with **ARM_FaultRecord** function
the fault information can be output to the **Event Recorder** or with the **ARM_FaultPrint** function it can be output to the STDIO.
